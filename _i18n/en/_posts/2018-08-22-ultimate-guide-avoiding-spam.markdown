<h3>Email providers' spam filters do their job, and are expected to continuously improve. At the same time, spammers will improve their practices. The following recommendations will help decrease spam in your inbox, and since they correspond to recurring habits, I hope they serve you forever.</h3>

It is expected that email providers, such as gmail, hotmail, zoho, among others, offer services to protect you from spam, but they are not enough considering that at the same time, spammers improve their practices. The final point **ad eternum** corresponds to integrating the habit of the following practices:

1. **Use alternative alias accounts** If your email provider allows you to create email aliases for users and you are the admin, you can create and delete email aliases, which are emails that arrive in the main inbox, while the sender only knows that alias. Use **email aliases** to register on new or suspicious sites. The golden rule is to **delete these aliases and create new ones periodically**.
2. Use the **email reader's own** (e.g., Gmail, Office, etc.) [Report Spam](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/1366858?co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS&hl=en) or [Report Phishing](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/8253?hl=en) feature to delete these messages. In other words, **never unsubscribe from an unwanted email by clicking on a link inside the email**, since a good spammer will track that click to validate that the email exists; therefore, only use the Mark as Spam or Phishing button in your email reader.
3. **Do not load images in emails**. By loading images in an email, you notify the spammer that the email was read. Tools that perform "mass email sends" use this technique, in some cases loading only invisible images whose sole purpose is to notify the sender that you have opened the email.
