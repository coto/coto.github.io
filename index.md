### Who am I?

Born in Chile, King of my freedom. Technology-er. I am good in Physics, Maths, creating valuable applications with simple user interfaces and seeting up high-demand technology infrastructures. I understand from how the silicon entrails works (hardware) to how the electrical signals circulates through their reils[^reils] (software). I specialize in Wireless Power Transfer. 

My life project is creating [innocuous wireless charging technologies][neahtid]{:target="_blank"}. I Enjoy meeting different cultures and traveling the world.

Free of religions and Politics.



[^reils]: Reils: A term used to refer Rails + Veins.
