This is my personal site, includes a [Free Topics Blog Posts][blog]{:target="_blank"} with undetermined update frequency. All the content is my own and has no relation to third parties.

### Who am I?

King of my freedom. Technology-er. I understand technology from how the silicon entrails works (hardware) to how the information circulates through their reils[^reils] (software). I am good programming (mostly Python and JavaScript).

I am able to set up a high-level technology infrastructures into the cloud, maybe you have used some of them.

Last but not least, my life project is bringing [innocuous wireless charging solutions][neahtid]{:target="_blank"} to those who need it, enjoying meeting new cultures and traveling around the world at the same time.

No religions. No Politics.
