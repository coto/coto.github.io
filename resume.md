<h3>Rodrigo (Coto) Augosto Cancino</h3>

### AI & Machine Learning Technical Lead \| Agentic Systems Architect

15+ Yrs Technology Leadership (Former CTO) \| LangGraph, PyTorch, TypeScript & Python

---

Most AI agents are easy to demo but hard to scale. I bridge that gap by building production-ready **Intelligent Automation** systems that are deterministic, secure, and mathematically grounded.

With over 15 years in technology leadership—including tenure as a **Fintech CTO**—I specialize in moving AI initiatives from experimental chatbots to enterprise-grade **Agentic Workflows**. My approach combines high-level business strategy with deep architectural expertise in **LangGraph**, **PyTorch**, and the **Agent2Agent** protocol.

**Core Expertise:**

- 🤖 **Agentic Orchestration**: Designing reliable state-machine workflows to solve complex, non-linear logic challenges with 99.9% reliability.
- 🧠 **Deep Learning & Computer Vision**: Developed end-to-end ML pipelines (PyTorch) for financial pattern recognition, utilizing Gramian Angular Fields (GAF) and CNNs for high-precision trend analysis.
- 📚 **Advanced RAG**: Building high-precision Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems to automate knowledge retrieval via Model Context Protocol (MCP).
- 🛡️ **Governance & Trust**: Establishing secure "Trust Layers," PII-scrubbing, and model evaluation pipelines (RAGAS/TruLens) for regulated sectors.
- ⚡ **Edge AI**: Leveraging an Electronics Engineering foundation to optimize model inference and latency for high-performance real-time environments.

**The Impact**: I consistently deliver 40%+ gains in operational ROI by aligning emerging AI research with scalable engineering excellence.
